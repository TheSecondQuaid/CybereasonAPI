# CybereasonAPI
 PowerShell module containing commands to easily interact with the Cybereason API. Once I get all the functions added I plan to add I will add this to PowerShell Gallery for easy installs.<br>
 __RESOURCE:__ [Cybereason API Documentation](https://nest.cybereason.com/documentation/api-documentation)

## Current Cmdlets
__Connect-CybereasonAPI__: This cmdlet is used to authenticate to the Cybereason API. This will create a global variable called $Session that will get used with the rest of the cmdlets in this module that need it.
```powershell
Connect-CybereasonAPI -Username 'admin@cybereason.com' -Passwd 'Password123!' -Server 'aaaaaaaa.cybereason.net' -Port '8443' -ClearHistory -Verbose
# This authenticates to the Cybereason API creating a session that gets used with all cmdlets in this module
```

__Get-CybereasonReputations__: This cmdlet is used to view or download a CSV list of reputation information that have been manually configured on your environments Cybereason server.
[Documentation for Manage Reputations](https://nest.cybereason.com/documentation/api-documentation/all-versions/manage-reputations)
- Return a list of reputations that have been configured on Cybereason for your environment and view it in CSV format in your terminal window
- Return a list of reputations that have been configured on Cybereason for your environment and view it in CSV format and save it to a file
```powershell
Get-CybereasonReputations -Verbose
# OR TO SAVE TO CSV FILE
Get-CybereasonReputations -Path C:\Windows\Temp\CybereasonReputations.csv
```

__Set-CybereasonReputations__: This cmdlet is used to add or update a custom reputation on the Cybereason server instance. Using the Cybereason Reputation Management API, you can integrate and update threat intelligence from various sources to improve detections, view and update file reputations, and add items to the whitelist based on behavioral characteristics.
- Add or remove reputations for a file using its hash or filename by adding it to a whitelist or blacklist. You can also prevent execution of the file throughout your environment
- Add or remove reputations for an IP address by adding it to a whitelist or blacklist
- Add or remove reputations for a domain by adding it to a whitelist or blacklist
```powershell
Set-CybereasonReputations -Keys '1.1.1.1' -Modify whitelist -Action Add -PreventExecution false -Verbose
Set-CybereasonReputations -Keys '8.8.8.8','www.cybereason.com' -Modify whitelist -Action Remove -PreventExecution false -Verbose
Set-CybereasonReputations -File 'C:\Users\Enemy\badFile.exe','C:\Users\Enemy\persistence.exe' -Modify blacklist -Action Add -PreventExecution true -Verbose
```

__Remediate Items__ <br>
 By using the API you can take remediation actions on Malops to limit or prevent additional damage.
- Remediate an item
- Check the status of a remediation
- Abort a remediation operation
- Get remediation statuses for a particular Malop <br>
[Documentation for Remediate Items](https://nest.cybereason.com/documentation/api-documentation/all-versions/remediate-items-0)

__Invoke-CybereasonRemediateItem__: This uses the Cybereason API to perform a remediation action on a specific file, process, or registry key.

# This example remediates a process that was not involved in a Malop
```

__Get-CybereasonRemediationProgress__: This cmdlet is used too return details on the progress of a specific remediation operation.
```powershell
Get-CybereasonRemediationProgress -Username 'admin@cyberason.com' -MalopID '11.2718161727221199870' -RemediationID '86f3faa1-bac0-4a17-9192-9d106b734664'
# This example gets the current status on a Malop that was remediated by the user admin@cyberason.com
```

__Stop-CybereasonMalopRemediation__: This cmdlet aborts a remediation operation on a specific Malop.
```powershell
Stop-CybereasonMalopRemediation -MalopID '11.2718161727221199870' -RemediationID '86f3faa1-bac0-4a17-9192-9d106b734664'

# This example gets the current status for the defined Malop
```

__Set-MachineIsolationRules__: <br>
Normally, when a machine is isolated, there is absolutely no communication allowed with the machine. This can sometimes limit the ability of an analyst or administrator to perform investigation or triage on that machine. However, you can add isolation exception rules to help you allow limited communication to an isolated machine

- __Get-CybereasonIsolationRules__ Retrieve a list of isolation rules 
```powershell
Get-CybereasonIsolationRules
# This example retrieves a list of all rules for isolating specific machines
```

- __New-CybereasonIsolationRule__ Create an isolation rule
```powershell
New-CybereasonIsolationRule -IPAddressString '123.45.67.89' -PortNumber 8443 -Blocking -Direction ALL
# This example creates a new isolation rule that blocks All communication to 123.45.67.89
```

- __Set-CybereasonIsolationRule__ Update an isolation rule
```powershell
Set-CybereasonIsolationRule -RuleID "5a7b2e95e4b082f2e909a4f3" -IPAddressString '123.45.67.89' -PortNumber 8443 -Blocking -Direction ALL
# This example creates a new isolation rule that blocks All communication to 123.45.67.89
```

- __Remove-CybereasonIsolationRule__ Delete an isolation rule
```powershell
Remove-CybereasonIsolationRule -RuleID '5859b3d0ae8eeb920e9d2f4e' -IPAddressString '1.1.1.1' -PortNumber 8443 -Direction ALL -LastUpdated 1525594605852
# This example deletes the isolation rule that is blocking all traffic to 1.1.1.1

Remove-CybereasonIsolationRule -RuleID '5859b3d0ae8eeb920e9d2f4e' -IPAddressString '10.10.10.10' -PortNumber 8443 -Blocking -Direction OUTGOING -LastUpdated 1525594605852
# This example deletes the rule ID that has IP address 10.10.10.10 outbound traffic blocked
