# CybereasonAPI
 PowerShell module containing commands to easily interact with the Cybereason API. Once I get all the functions added I plan to add I will add this to PowerShell Gallery for easy installs.<br>

__Invoke-RespondToMalops__: By using the API you can retrieve Malops or isolate machines involved in a specific Malop. This can prove to be very useful in situations where you are remediating Malops in your ticketing system and you would like to synchronize that system with Cybereason Malop inbox.
- Get all Malops currently active
- Retrieve all Malops of all types
- Retrieve details on a specific Malop
- Perform all possible response actions on a Malop
- Perform all possible response actions on a Malop
- Isolate a machine connected with a Malop
- Remove a machine involved with a Malop from isolation
- Update a Malopâ€™s status
- Add a comment to a Malop
- Get a list of Malop labels
- Create a Malop label
- Delete a Malop label
- Update Malop labels <br>

__Invoke-RespondToMalware__: By using the API you can retrieve details on malware. This enables you to address and investigate malware to prevent additional damage.
- Get a count of all Malware per type
- Query a specific type of Malware <br>

__Invoke-RemediateItems__: By using the API you can take remediation actions on Malops to limit or prevent additional damage.
- Remediate an item
- Check the status of a remediation
- Abort a remediation operation
- Get remediation statuses for a particular Malop <br>
[Documentation for Remediate Items](https://nest.cybereason.com/documentation/api-documentation/all-versions/remediate-items-0)

__Add-CustomDetectionRule__: Custom detection rules created via API should be created only after adequate research regarding precision and coverage has been completed. Creating a custom detection rule that is not specific enough can have detrimental impact on retention and overall performance of the environment.
- Retrieve a list of all active custom detection rules
- Retrieve a list of all disabled custom detection rules
- Retrieve a list of all available root causes
- Retrieve a list of all available Malop detection types
- Retrieve a list of all available Malop activity types
- Create a custom rule
- Update a custom rule
- Get the modification history <br>

__Set-MachineIsolationRules__: Normally, when a machine is isolated, there is absolutely no communication allowed with the machine. This can sometimes limit the ability of an analyst or administrator to perform investigation or triage on that machine. However, you can add isolation exception rules to help you allow limited communication to an isolated machine
- Retrieve a list of isolation rules 
- Create an isolation rule
- Update an isolation rule
- Delete an isolation rule <br>
